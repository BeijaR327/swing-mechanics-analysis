# Swing Mechanics Analysis ðŸŽ¯

This project analyzes baseball swing motion data to generate coach-readable insights.  
It detects swing events, computes biomechanical metrics, and produces visual and written feedback to help athletes and coaches improve real-world performance.

## ðŸ§© Key Features
- Cleans and validates raw swing CSV data
- Detects swing start, max speed, and contact points
- Calculates hipâ€“shoulder separation, attack angle, and acceleration
- Generates an easy-to-read coach summary (PDF)

## ðŸ“Š Files
- **Swing_Mechanics_Analysis_Patched.ipynb** â€“ Full analysis notebook  
- **Swing_Coach_Notes.pdf** â€“ Human-readable coach summary

## ðŸš€ Tools Used
Python Â· pandas Â· numpy Â· matplotlib Â· biomechanical data processing

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback Welcome!
If you have suggestions on improving the analysis or communicating the results better, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.
